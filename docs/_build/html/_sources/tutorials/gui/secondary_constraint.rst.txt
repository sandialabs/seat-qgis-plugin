Secondary Constraint
--------------------

Currently only used for paracousti and will be ignored for shear stress and velocity. For Paracousti, this points to the directory containing species percent and species density files. Both must be present in the same folder. The names of each file and what conditions they apply to is in the Model Probabilities File.
