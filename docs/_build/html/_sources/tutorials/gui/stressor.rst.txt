Stressor
--------

To choose the analysis/data type in the "Select Stressor" Dropdown box. Currently 3 options exist

- **Shear Stress Module** – analysis of spatial change in bed mobility
- **Velocity Module**	- analysis of spatial change in larval motility
- **ParAcousti Module** – analysis of acoustic propagation and thresholds

Only one stressor model cand be run at a time this makes saving the inputs in the bottom left important before running starting a model analysis.
