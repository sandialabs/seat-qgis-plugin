Sedimentation Analysis (Shear Stress)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Evaluate the impact of CEC devices on sediment mobility considering a single median grain size receptor in a CSV file.

Input
""""""
At this point you should have already setup the input files as detailed in :ref:`preparing_input_files` and prepared the style files as detailed in :ref:`prepare_style_files`. 

To run this demonstration, use the **Load GUI Inputs** button located at the bottom left of the SEAT GUI, navigate to :file:`DEMO/DEMO unstructured/shear_stress_with_receptor_demo.ini`, and click OK to load the inputs. If you need detailed instructions on how to load inputs, please refer to the :ref:`save_load_config` section in the :ref:`gui` documention.

To see a full list of files used in the demonstartion please refer to :ref:`unstructured_files`. In breif the model data which consists of individual .nc files for each flow return period. The period within the ``.nc`` filename determines the probability of occurrence. There is a set of results for no device and a set of results for 9 devices in the river.

   Before clicking OK ensure the complete path matches the location on your machine. Your paths will be different than the ones shown in the example below.

Output
""""""

The above input set evaluates the impact on sediment mobility considering a single median grain size receptor in a CSV file. The probability-weighted shear stress with devices is compared to the scenario without devices. The resulting stressor (change in shear stress), stressor with receptor (change in sediment mobility), and the reclassified stressor from the analysis are illustrated below.

Each layer will look as shown below. To add the map layer see the :ref:`map` section.
