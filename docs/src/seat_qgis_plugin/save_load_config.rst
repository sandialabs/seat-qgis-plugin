Save & Load Configuration
---------------------------

Found in the bottom left corner, this feature allows users to save the current configuration to a `.ini` file, which can be reloaded later to quickly restore the configuration settings.

- **Saving Configuration**:

  - Ensure all desired fields are populated.
  - Save the current configuration to a `.ini` file for future use by clicking on the "Save GUI Inputs" button.

- **Loading Configuration**:

  - Load a previously saved `.ini` file to restore the configuration settings.

- **Example Configurations**:

  - Several example `.ini` files are provided along with the demo data.

  .. note:: 
    The example `.ini` files are provided for demonstration purposes only. They are not intended to be used as-is. 
    Users should update the file paths in the example `.ini` files to match their local setup. Users can update the files using the `localize_tutorial_files.py` script in the tutorials folder.
